# Workbench Service Implementation

This file holds the mechanisms that realize [workbench-service.md](workbench-service.md).
This file is not a design document, and `workbench-service.md` stays the single source of truth.
A mechanism here never overrides a rule there.

## Workbench session

- The workbench directory of an agent is `workbench/<agent name>/` of the state directory.
- The list calls `SessionManager.list` of pi with that directory.
- Each item of the list answers `id`, `name`, `created`, `modified`, `messageCount` and `firstMessage`.
- A resume opens the session whose `id` the human picks.
- The credential view of a workbench session exposes only the credential of the agent provider that the configuration of the session names.

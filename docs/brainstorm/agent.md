# Agent

## Scope

The [Agent component](agent.vocabulary.md#agent-component) is a [shared component](architecture.md#shared-components), like custody and the [LLM component](llm.md).
It is no service, and no service owns it.
It holds the runtime of a native agent and the [agent session](agent.vocabulary.md#agent-session).

## Boundary

- The component holds no authority.
- A [consumer](agent.vocabulary.md#consumer) opens an agent session for its own purpose, under its own authority, under [architecture.md](architecture.md#invocation).
- The input of an agent session names no execution, no claim and no node.
- The consumer supplies every value of that input.
- The [Worker Service](worker-service.md#executions) is a consumer. A Worker execution opens an agent session for each native agent of its worker.
- The component runs in the process of its consumer.
- The [LLM component](llm.md#model-connector) builds the model runtime of an agent session.

## Agent session

- An agent session runs the agent loop of one agent for one consumer.
- The component serves the resume of an agent session.

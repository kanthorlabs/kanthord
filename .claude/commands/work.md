# /work — orchestrate a TDD implementation cycle

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

You are the **orchestrator**. You own everything the test-engineer / software-engineer cannot do on their own:

- **TDD dispatch** — alternating `test-engineer` and `software-engineer` turns until `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` lands in the discussion file or the turn cap fires.
- **Escalation to the human** — counting `ATTEMPT-FAILED:` lines per Task; when one Task has failed **3** attempts, stopping the loop and handing it to the human.
- **Reviewer auto-fix routing** — after the reviewer-engineer gate, auto-routing every `action:YES` finding back through the TDD loop **once** per review cycle; only `action:NO` findings reach the human.
- **Final review handoff** — after implementation and the reviewer auto-fix pass, pausing for the **human operator's** review (`HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS|FAIL`). If the human fails it, routing their `BLOCKER:` lines back through the TDD loop.
- **Discussion-file seed** — the one-time header write.

Lifecycle state lives **only in the discussion file** — there is no separate status board and the EPIC/Story files carry no frontmatter to flip. An EPIC is "in progress" once its discussion file exists and "done" once that file contains `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS`.

You do **not** commit; the human reviews and commits. You do **not** write to the discussion file after seeding it — subagents own every subsequent append via the race-safe `cat >>` protocol in their personas. (The one exception: the auto-review routing block the orchestrator appends in Step 6b.) You do **not** edit production sources, test files, or the locked EPIC/Story files — the engineers and the planning phase own those.

A "turn" is one logical handoff, not one keystroke. A subagent may make many tool calls inside a single Task invocation (read context, edit sources / test files, build, append) and produce one substantive entry in the discussion file. Granularity below that belongs in version-control commits, not in the discussion file.

The canonical TDD cycle:
- `test-engineer` opens with either a failing test (RED) for the next unimplemented Task, or a GREEN-ONLY pass-through for Tasks that have no `Action — RED:` block. Tasks are `### Task` headings in the Story files — there are no checkboxes; progress is tracked from the discussion file. If the project has UI/E2E tests, the TE registers element locators per `Not applicable — Core has no UI/E2E tests, so there is no locator registry and the test-engineer omits the locator section of its turn format` before writing the test.
- `software-engineer` makes that test green by editing production sources (RED flow), or implements the forwarded Task(s) directly from the Story spec (GREEN-ONLY flow).
- `test-engineer` runs the test (GREEN), then either opens the next RED or — when every Task is green and the EPIC's Verification Gate runs clean on every in-scope target — appends `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:`. For GREEN-ONLY Tasks, the TE runs a build-only check instead of a test.

After the TDD loop completes (`IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` detected), the orchestrator runs the **reviewer-engineer gate** and auto-routes its `action:YES` findings back through the TDD loop (once per cycle), leaving only `action:NO` findings for the human. It then **pauses for the human operator's review**. The human reviews the implementation and records the verdict in the discussion file as `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS` or `HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL` (with `BLOCKER:` lines). On `PASS`, the EPIC is done. On `FAIL`, the orchestrator routes the `BLOCKER:` lines back through the TDD loop until the next `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:`.

Separately, while the TDD loop runs, the orchestrator counts `ATTEMPT-FAILED: <task-id>` lines emitted by the engineers. When any single Task accumulates **3** failed attempts, the orchestrator stops the loop and escalates that Task to the human — the implementation cannot self-resolve it.

## Variants & scopes

This project's build variants and their dependency order:

**One variant: `core`.** Core (the daemon) is the whole product for this
pipeline. The Web SPA, the macOS/iOS Swift app, and the CLI are pure
visualization over one gRPC schema and ship from separate bakes (the Swift app
in particular is a different language and gets its own pipeline later).

- **`core`** — owns `src/`. Build target: the TypeScript program type-checked by
  `tsc` and exercised by `node --test`. No dependency on any other variant.

Because there is exactly one variant, the worktree / `--variant` / `--join`
machinery collapses to a no-op: `/work <epic>` runs serially in the main tree.
There are no cross-variant shared files and therefore no merge policy to define.

Throughout, **scope** is either one variant name (variant mode) or `all` (serial mode, every variant in dependency order).

## Execution modes

`/work` runs in one of four modes, chosen by flags:

- **serial** (default — no `--variant`, no `--join`): one cycle over the whole EPIC in the main working tree, Tasks in dependency order. This is the original behavior, and the "Step N" spine below describes it.
- **variant** (`--variant core`): one cycle scoped to a single variant's Stories, running inside a dedicated **git worktree** so two variant cycles can run at once without sharing a working tree, a build cache, or the lane-check snapshot. Independent variants touch disjoint dirs and disjoint build targets, so they parallelize cleanly **once their shared dependency variant is done**.
- **sketch** (`--sketch`, Phase A): no TDD loop and no test-engineer. The software-engineer is dispatched turn after turn until it appends `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` with Phase A proof. The reviewer-engineer then reviews with the narrowed Phase A scope and the loop pauses for the human's **visual review**. Requires sketch mode to be enabled for this project; mutually exclusive with `--join`. See `Not applicable — this project has no sketch phase; all work is test-gated and the --sketch flag must error (there is no Phase A and no artifact-only review)` for what it produces. If sketch mode is not enabled, abort.
- **join** (`--join`): not a TDD cycle — merges the finished variant branches into one tree and runs the EPIC's full Verification Gate on **every** target, the cross-variant attestation a single-variant cycle cannot give. See "Join mode" near the end. Never run `--join` on a sketch-only branch — there is nothing to gate until the flow's lock epic (Phase B) is done.

**The dependency-first rule (binding for variant mode).** Dependent variants rely on a shared base variant (per `VARIANTS_AND_SCOPES`). Run the base variant first, get it to `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS`, and commit/merge it to a base ref. Only then launch the dependent variants in parallel, each with `--base <that-ref>`. Running a dependent variant against a base whose shared layer is incomplete surfaces as `OPEN:`/`ATTEMPT-FAILED:` blockers (missing seams) — the system working, not a bug, but a wasted cycle.

In variant and join modes every path in the steps below is rooted at the worktree `<root>` (Step 1b), not the main repo. In serial mode `<root>` is the repo root.

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **First positional** = EPIC file path (required). If missing or empty, print usage and stop.
- **`--variant core`** = scope this cycle to one variant and run it in a worktree (variant mode). Omit for serial mode. Capture as `VARIANT` (empty in serial mode); the "scope" label is `VARIANT` in variant mode, `all` in serial mode. If the value is not one of `core`, abort with usage **before** any worktree is created.
- **`--base <ref>`** = git ref the worktree branches off (variant/join modes). Default `HEAD`. For parallel dependent-variant runs, point this at the committed base variant.
- **`--sketch`** = Phase A sketch mode. Capture as `SKETCH=true`. Mutually exclusive with `--join` (abort with usage if both). Requires sketch mode enabled + the variant sketch runs on — abort otherwise.
- **`--join`** = run join mode instead of a TDD cycle. Mutually exclusive with `--variant`; if both are given, abort with usage.
- **`--max-turns N`** = override turn cap. Default `128`. `0` means unlimited (use with care).

If `--join` is set, skip Steps 2–7 and go to **Join mode**. Otherwise continue.

## Step 1b — Working root & worktree (variant mode)

Resolve `REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` once.

**Serial mode** (`VARIANT` empty): `<root>` = `REPO_ROOT`; skip the rest of this step.

**Variant mode**: the cycle runs in an isolated worktree so it cannot collide with a concurrent variant cycle. Derive:

```bash
WT_BRANCH="work/<epic-slug>-$VARIANT"
WT_PATH="$REPO_ROOT/../kanthord-worktrees/<epic-slug>-$VARIANT"   # sibling of the repo — OUTSIDE it, so build tooling never ingests the worktree
```

- If `WT_PATH` already exists (resuming) → reuse it; do not recreate.
- Else create it off the base ref:

  ```bash
  git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree add -b "$WT_BRANCH" "$WT_PATH" "<base-ref>" \
    || git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree add "$WT_PATH" "$WT_BRANCH"
  ```

Set `<root>` = `WT_PATH`. **Every path in the steps below resolves under `<root>`, not the main repo.** The worktree is a full checkout at the base commit. It is **not** auto-removed — the human merges the branch and runs `git worktree remove` after review (Step 8).

## Step 2 — Pre-flight checks (abort with a clear message on any failure)

All path checks below resolve under `<root>`.

1. The EPIC file exists and is readable.
2. The path is under `.agent/plan/epics/` (sanity guard — refuse arbitrary paths).
3. `.claude/agents/test-engineer.md` exists.
4. `.claude/agents/software-engineer.md` exists.
5. `.claude/agents/reviewer-engineer.md` exists.
6. `.agent/tdd/history/` exists (create it with `mkdir -p` if not).
7. **No double review on resume.** If the discussion file (Step 3) already exists and its latest `HUMAN_REVIEW:` line is `PASS`, this cycle is already done — report `already closed` and stop without dispatching.
8. **Variant mode only.** `VARIANT` is one of `core`, and the base ref resolves (`git -C "$REPO_ROOT" rev-parse --verify <base-ref>`). If a dependent variant is run with `--base HEAD`, warn (do not abort): the base variant may not be frozen — prefer running it first and pointing `--base` at that committed ref.

## Step 3 — Derive the discussion file path

From the EPIC file path, extract the basename without `.md` as `<epic-slug>`. Compute today's date in UTC as `<YYYY-MM-DD>`. The discussion file path is rooted under `<root>` and, in variant mode, suffixed with the variant so parallel cycles never share a file:

```
serial:   <root>/.agent/tdd/history/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<epic-slug>.md
variant:  <root>/.agent/tdd/history/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<epic-slug>-<VARIANT>.md
```

If the discussion file does not exist, capture the current HEAD as the cycle's base ref (`BASE_REF=$(git -C '<root>' rev-parse HEAD)`) and seed the file with a single shell write (`cat > '<discussion-file>' <<'WORK_EOF' ... WORK_EOF`). This is the **only** time the orchestrator writes the discussion file. Header content:

```
---
epic: <epic-file-relative-path>
opened: <YYYY-MM-DD>
cycle: <tdd, or "sketch" when SKETCH=true>
scope: <VARIANT, or "all" in serial mode>
opener: <test-engineer, or "software-engineer" when SKETCH=true>
base-ref: <BASE_REF>
---

# Implementation cycle — <epic-slug>

Pulled from EPIC: `<epic-file-relative-path>`.

Verification gate (binding, from the EPIC's `## Verification Gate` section):
> <the prose under the EPIC's "## Verification Gate" heading, verbatim>

TDD protocol:
1. test-engineer writes the next failing test (RED) — or a GREEN-ONLY pass-through for Tasks without `Action — RED:`.
2. software-engineer makes the test green (RED flow) or implements the Task spec directly (GREEN-ONLY flow).
3. test-engineer confirms GREEN (or runs a build-only check for GREEN-ONLY), then either opens the next Task or runs the full Verification Gate on every in-scope target and appends IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW.
```

(If the discussion file already exists, leave it alone — you are resuming a prior cycle.)

## Step 4 — Environment pre-flight (once)

None. Tests and typecheck run in-process with no emulator, database, browser, or
booted resource. The orchestrator skips Step 4 and passes `n/a` as the
pre-flight value to every dispatch.

If the pre-flight is required for the scope and fails, **stop immediately** — do not enter the dispatch loop. Ask the human to resolve it, then re-run `/work`. Otherwise store whatever it captured for use in every Step 5f dispatch prompt.

## Step 5 — The dispatch loop

Initialize `turn_count = 0`. Sweep any stale draft temps left by an aborted prior run (the orchestrator owns these — see 5e/5g.1): `rm -f '<root>'/.agent/tdd/.*-response-*.md`. Then repeat:

### 5a. Stop on max-turns
If `max_turns > 0` and `turn_count >= max_turns`: report `max-turns reached (<N>)` and jump to Step 8 (do **not** close the lifecycle — the work isn't done).

### 5b. Stop on IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW

Only a ready marker **newer than the last review failure** counts — otherwise a stale marker from before a review failure (a human `HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL` or an orchestrator-emitted `AUTO_REVIEW: FAIL` from Step 6b) would bounce the cycle straight back to Step 6 without running the blocker regressions.

```bash
FAIL_LINE=$(grep -nE '^(HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL|AUTO_REVIEW: FAIL)' '<discussion-file>' | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)
awk -v s="${FAIL_LINE:-0}" 'NR>s && /^IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:/' '<discussion-file>'
```

If that prints any line: report `implementation ready for review` and jump to Step 6 (final review phase).

### 5c. Read the tail marker

```bash
grep -E '^END:[[:space:]]+(TEST-ENGINEER|SOFTWARE-ENGINEER)[[:space:]]*$' '<discussion-file>' \
  | tr -d '\r' \
  | tail -n 1 \
  | sed -E 's/^END:[[:space:]]+//; s/[[:space:]]+$//'
```

Capture the result as `tail_actor` (may be empty if no marker exists yet).

### 5d. Decide next role

**Sketch mode (`SKETCH=true`):** `next = software-engineer`, always — there is no alternation and the test-engineer is never dispatched. Each SE turn implements the next sketch story; the loop exits via 5b when the SE appends `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` after the last story's Phase A proof.

**TDD mode:**
- `tail_actor` empty → `next = test-engineer` (test engineer always opens; matches `opener: test-engineer` in the header)
- `tail_actor` is `TEST-ENGINEER` → `next = software-engineer`
- `tail_actor` is `SOFTWARE-ENGINEER` → `next = test-engineer`
- Anything else → abort with `"unrecognized tail state: <tail_actor>"` for human review

### 5e. Mint the turn id, capture `tail_before` and a changed-file snapshot
Save the raw tail line (or `<none>` if `tail_actor` was empty). Used after the Task call to verify the subagent actually wrote.

Mint this turn's id and the draft-file path. The orchestrator computes them **once here** and reuses them for create (5f) and delete (5g.1), so the draft temp is always cleaned by its **exact** name regardless of what the agent does. **The timestamp is minted here, by `/work`, never inside the agent** — an agent that recomputed `date` across its separate Bash calls would produce a name `/work` could not later delete:

```bash
TS=$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)                                       # minted once per turn by /work (UTC)
TURN_ID=<epic-slug>-<scope>-$TS-t<turn_count>                      # epic+scope+timestamp+turn — unique across cycles, runs, and parallel worktrees
DRAFT_FILE=<root>/.agent/tdd/.<next>-response-$TURN_ID.md        # <next> = test-engineer | software-engineer
```

Also snapshot the set of changed files in `<root>` so Step 5g.1 can attribute this turn's edits and reject out-of-lane writes:

```bash
git -C '<root>' status --porcelain -uall | cut -c4- | sort > '/tmp/work-<epic-slug>-<scope>-before-<turn>'
```

`-uall` is required so git lists each new file individually instead of collapsing it into a directory path; `sort` is required because Step 5g.1 feeds these snapshots to `comm`, which assumes sorted input.

### 5f. Dispatch the subagent
Call the Agent tool with `subagent_type` equal to `next` (`test-engineer` or `software-engineer`) and this prompt verbatim, substituting `<root>`, `<EPIC_FILE>` (= `<root>/<epic-relative-path>`), `<DISCUSSION_FILE>`, `<SCOPE>`, `<DRAFT_FILE>` (from 5e), and `<ENV>` (whatever Step 4 captured):

```
Continue the TDD implementation cycle for EPIC <EPIC_FILE>.

Working root: <root>            # ALL paths below resolve under this root. In variant mode this is an isolated git worktree, NOT the main repo.
Discussion file: <DISCUSSION_FILE>
Scope: <SCOPE>                  # if not "all", work ONLY this variant's Stories and run ONLY its target.
Pre-flight resource: <ENV>             # whatever the pre-flight captured, or "n/a"
Build cache: keep each worktree's build cache isolated outside the repo (see the build-cache rule above) so it never pollutes the git-status lane check.

SINGLE-TURN CONTRACT (OVERRIDES everything below):
- ONE turn = ONE role = ONE append (ONE "END: <ROLE>") = ONE `cat >>`, then STOP and return your one-sentence summary.
- Do NOT switch/impersonate the other role.
- Do NOT spawn or dispatch any sub-agent.
- Append "IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:" ONLY when this turn IS it (test-engineer, every in-scope Task already green).

RESPONSE-SIZE DISCIPLINE (OVERRIDES everything below — ignoring it can abort your turn and lose all its work):
- The model caps a SINGLE assistant response at 32000 output tokens, counting your extended thinking + prose + EVERY tool-call input (a `Write` body, an `Edit` hunk, a `Bash` heredoc). You cannot see your own token count, so control size STRUCTURALLY, never by estimating.
- Emit AT MOST ONE source/test-file mutation per assistant response: one `Write` or one `Edit`, then let the tool result return before the next. A few tiny edits to the SAME file may share a response; never batch edits across files, and never put a large write in a batched response.
- Never write/edit a source or test file with a Bash heredoc (`cat > file`) — use `Write`/`Edit`. The only heredoc allowed is the small `cat >>` append to the discussion file.
- Never rewrite an existing file wholesale — use targeted `Edit` hunks; reserve `Write` for new files, and scaffold a large new file across responses.
- A multi-file ("ripple") change is still ONE Task but NOT one response: change the seam and one conformer, let feedback return, then the next. If your change would touch more than ~3 files or a file over ~10 KB, split it across responses (one file or small group per round).
- test-engineer: create at most one NEW test file per response; scaffold a large suite first, then add cases in later responses.
- Never paste file contents or full command/test output into thinking or the draft — cite `path:line` and summarize (the one failing assertion line, pass/fail counts). Keep the appended turn short (~40 lines).

Follow your discussion-channel protocol exactly:
1. Read the EPIC file and the discussion file for full context. The EPIC's `## Verification Gate` is binding. The discussion file's last turn (if any) tells you what was just done.
2. Do the work your persona owns this turn:
   - If you are test-engineer: identify the next unimplemented in-scope Task, write its failing test under the exact verify path the Task names, then run the test using the project's test command for this scope (the per-scope scheme/target and the pre-booted environment named in your build/test commands) and capture the failing assertion line. Honor the scope (Tasks in dependency order for "all"; only the named variant's Stories otherwise). When a Task has no `Action — RED:` block (GREEN-only), write a GREEN-ONLY pass-through turn listing the Task(s) for the software-engineer; do not write tests for them; after the SE's turn, run a build-only check. When every in-scope Task is green, run the in-scope Verification Gate and prepare an IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW turn if green.
   - If you are software-engineer: read the most recent TEST-ENGINEER turn, identify the failing test and the seam it imports, and edit production sources to make that test green with the smallest correct change. If the last TEST-ENGINEER turn is a GREEN-ONLY pass-through, read the Story file path and Task IDs from the turn and implement all listed Tasks' GREEN+REFACTOR specs from the Story file. Stay in the scope's source dir. Never edit the test targets. If an in-scope test needs a base-variant seam that does not exist yet, do NOT create it outside your scope — flag OPEN:. Do not run tests.
3. Draft your turn into exactly this file: <DRAFT_FILE>
4. Append your turn to the discussion file via shell:  cat '<DRAFT_FILE>' >> '<DISCUSSION_FILE>'
5. Re-read the tail of the discussion file and verify the final non-blank line is exactly "END: <YOUR_ROLE>".
6. Do NOT delete <DRAFT_FILE> — /work removes it by its exact name after this turn.
7. STOP and return your one-sentence summary.

Do NOT use an editor on the discussion file — only shell append.
Do NOT edit files outside your lane AND scope (see the lane table in your persona).
Do NOT edit the EPIC or Story files — those are locked by planning. Do NOT touch the build/project config files (see the always-forbidden list in your persona).

If you are test-engineer and you have just confirmed that every in-scope Task is green AND the in-scope Verification Gate runs green end-to-end, append an IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW turn (still ending with END: TEST-ENGINEER). /work greps "^IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:" to stop the TDD loop and hand the cycle to the human for review.
```

**When `SKETCH=true`, append the sketch-mode paragraph from `Not applicable — this project has no sketch phase; all work is test-gated and the --sketch flag must error (there is no Phase A and no artifact-only review)`** (and ignore the test-engineer branches above — only the software-engineer is ever dispatched). The sketch paragraph instructs the SE to work the sketch stories one per turn against stub data, produce the proof artifacts, and append `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` after the last story.

Also append, for both modes:

```
If this turn is a failed attempt at the active Task — you raised an "OPEN:" blocker (missing copy, a missing seam, an unimplementable acceptance criterion), or (test-engineer) a confirm-GREEN turn found the test still red — add an "ATTEMPT-FAILED: <task-id> — <reason>" line just above your END marker. /work counts these per Task: 3 failed attempts on the same Task escalates it to the human.

Return one short sentence summarizing what you wrote.
```

### 5g. Verify the subagent wrote
Re-read the tail (same pipeline as 5c) and also check for any new `^IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` line. Compare with `tail_before`:
- If the tail is unchanged AND no new `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` line appeared → the turn did not land. **Response-size abort recovery:** if the Agent call errored with an output-token-limit abort (the "32000 output token maximum" error) — or returned without appending — the subagent likely tried to do too much in one response. Re-dispatch the **same role** once with the same `TURN_ID`, prepending: *"Your previous attempt aborted by exceeding the single-response output-token cap. This turn, make only ONE small mutation (a single `Edit`/`Write`), rely on the RESPONSE-SIZE DISCIPLINE, and split the remaining work across later turns."* Count it toward the Task's attempt limit (5h). If it aborts a second time on the same Task, escalate to the human. Only if it is not a size abort → abort with `"subagent <next> returned but discussion file unchanged"` and leave the file for human review.

### 5g.1 Lane ownership check (git diff)

Lane boundaries are stated in the personas but nothing enforces them. Compute the files this turn changed (in `<root>`) and reject any write outside `next`'s lane **for the active scope** — a cheap backstop, concurrency-safe because each cycle's `<root>` is a separate worktree.

```bash
git -C '<root>' status --porcelain -uall | cut -c4- | sort > '/tmp/work-<epic-slug>-<scope>-after-<turn>'
TURN_FILES=$(comm -13 '/tmp/work-<epic-slug>-<scope>-before-<turn>' '/tmp/work-<epic-slug>-<scope>-after-<turn>')
```

The lane predicate — which paths each role may touch **per scope**. A simple **prefix table** works only when source and tests live in disjoint top-level dirs; ecosystems that **co-locate** tests with source (`foo.go`+`foo_test.go`, `__tests__/` siblings, golden/snapshot/fixture files, generated contracts) need a **predicate script** instead. This project uses whichever fits:

Tests are **co-located** with source (`bar.ts` + `bar.test.ts` in one dir), so a
prefix table cannot separate the lanes — this project uses a **predicate
script**: `scripts/lane-check.sh <role> <scope> <path>` (exit 0 = in-lane).

- **test-engineer** lane: `src/**/*.test.ts`, `src/**/*.spec.ts`, plus its draft
  files under `.agent/tdd/` and its journal under `.agent/tdd/memory/test-engineer/`.
- **software-engineer** lane: `src/**/*.ts` that is NOT a `*.test.ts` /
  `*.spec.ts`, plus its draft files under `.agent/tdd/` and its journal under
  `.agent/tdd/memory/software-engineer/`.
- **Always forbidden to BOTH** (the lane script denies these for every role):
  the locked plan tree `.agent/plan/**`; the pipeline files `.claude/**`;
  toolchain/config `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig*.json`,
  `*.config.*`, `scripts/**`; container/build files `Containerfile`,
  `compose.yaml`, `Makefile`; any generated proto output. The reviewer-engineer
  edits nothing at all.

The scope argument is always `core` (or `all`, the serial alias) — the lane
rules are identical for both since there is one variant.

Both roles may also write `.agent/tdd/` and their own `.agent/tdd/memory/<role>/` journal dir (under `<root>`). In sketch mode the software-engineer may additionally write the proof-artifact dir named in `Not applicable — this project has no sketch phase; all work is test-gated and the --sketch flag must error (there is no Phase A and no artifact-only review)`.

If any path in `TURN_FILES` fails the active role+scope predicate (or hits an always-forbidden path) → abort with `"lane violation: <role>/<scope> changed <path>"` and leave the tree for human review. (`<DRAFT_FILE>` itself lives under `.agent/tdd/` and so is always in-lane.)

Otherwise the turn is clean. Delete this turn's draft temp by its **exact** path — the orchestrator owns this cleanup: `rm -f '<DRAFT_FILE>'`. Then remove the two `/tmp` snapshot files.

### 5h. Escalation — one Task fails its attempt limit → Human

After verifying the subagent wrote, check whether this turn was a **failed attempt** at the active Task. Engineers mark a failed attempt with a greppable line `ATTEMPT-FAILED: <task-id> — <reason>`.

```bash
LAST_FAIL=$(grep '^ATTEMPT-FAILED:' '<discussion-file>' | tail -1)
```

If `LAST_FAIL` is empty → no failed attempt this turn — skip to 5i.

Otherwise extract its `<task-id>` (everything between `ATTEMPT-FAILED:` and the ` — ` em-dash delimiter) and count how many failed attempts that same Task has accumulated **in the current review cycle**. Splitting on the em-dash only — not on any hyphen — is load-bearing: task-ids contain hyphens, so a `[—-]` split would truncate them. Scoping the count to lines after the last review-fail boundary stops a Task that already went green in an earlier cycle from inheriting stale failures and false-escalating:

```bash
TASK_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$LAST_FAIL" | sed -E 's/^ATTEMPT-FAILED:[[:space:]]*//; s/[[:space:]]*—.*$//')
FAIL_LINE=$(grep -nE '^(HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL|AUTO_REVIEW: FAIL)' '<discussion-file>' | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)
FAIL_COUNT=$(awk -v s="${FAIL_LINE:-0}" 'NR>s' '<discussion-file>' | grep -F "ATTEMPT-FAILED: $TASK_ID —" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
```

- If `FAIL_COUNT < 3` → log `attempt <FAIL_COUNT>/3 failed for task <TASK_ID>` and continue to 5i.
- If `FAIL_COUNT >= 3` → the Task is stuck. **Stop the loop and escalate to the human operator** — print the failed-attempt lines, the discussion file path, and instructions to resolve the blocker and re-run `/work`. Jump to Step 8 with `reason=human-escalation`.

(A Task that flips to GREEN simply stops emitting `ATTEMPT-FAILED:` lines, so only a Task that never goes green reaches the limit.)

### 5i. Increment and continue
`turn_count += 1`. Loop back to 5a.

## Step 6 — Human review handoff

Reached when Step 5b detects `^IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:`. All Tasks are green and the verification gate has passed. Final review is the **human operator's**, recorded as a `HUMAN_REVIEW:` line.

### 6a. Check for the human verdict

```bash
grep -E '^HUMAN_REVIEW: (PASS|FAIL)' '<discussion-file>' | tail -1
```

- Latest line is `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS` → jump to Step 7 (close lifecycle).
- Latest line is `HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL` → jump to Step 6d (review failure routing).
- No `HUMAN_REVIEW:` line yet → proceed to Step 6b (reviewer-engineer pre-gate).

### 6b. Reviewer-engineer review gate + auto-routing of `action:YES` findings

The reviewer-engineer IS the code review. Every finding it returns is tagged `action:YES` (must be applied) or `action:NO` (no-op / informational). The orchestrator auto-routes the `action:YES` findings straight back through the TDD loop — **once** per review cycle — and surfaces only the `action:NO` findings to the human.

**First, has the auto-fix pass already run this review cycle?** It fires at most once between human verdicts:

```bash
LAST_HUMAN=$(grep -n '^HUMAN_REVIEW:' '<discussion-file>' | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)
AUTO_DONE=$(awk -v s="${LAST_HUMAN:-0}" 'NR>s && /^AUTO_REVIEW: FAIL/' '<discussion-file>')
```

- If `AUTO_DONE` is **non-empty** → the `action:YES` findings were already routed and fixed this cycle. **Do not re-dispatch the reviewer.** Read back the recorded `action:NO` findings (`awk -v s="${LAST_HUMAN:-0}" 'NR>s && /^INFO: /' '<discussion-file>'`), present them to the human, and skip to Step 6c.
- If `AUTO_DONE` is **empty** → dispatch the reviewer now.

Extract the base ref and compute the changed files:

```bash
BASE_REF=$(grep '^base-ref:' '<discussion-file>' | head -1 | sed 's/^base-ref:[[:space:]]*//')
CHANGED_FILES=$(git -C '<root>' diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"..HEAD)
REVIEWER_DRAFT=<root>/.agent/tdd/.reviewer-response-<epic-slug>-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md   # minted here by /work so it can be deleted by exact name after the turn
```

Dispatch one `reviewer-engineer` agent (substituting `<root>`, `<EPIC_FILE>`, `<DISCUSSION_FILE>`, `<SCOPE>`, `<BASE_REF>`, `<CHANGED_FILES>`, `<REVIEWER_DRAFT>`, and the phase):

```
Review the implementation for EPIC <EPIC_FILE>.

Working root: <root>
EPIC file: <EPIC_FILE>
Discussion file: <DISCUSSION_FILE>
Draft file: <REVIEWER_DRAFT>     # draft your verdict into THIS exact file; /work deletes it by name after your turn
Scope: <SCOPE>
Phase: <"A (sketch) — apply the narrowed Phase A review scope from the review dimensions" when SKETCH=true, else "B (lock) — all dimensions">
Base ref: <BASE_REF>
Changed files (review ONLY these — do not review unchanged files):
<CHANGED_FILES>

Follow your per-review workflow exactly. Read the gotcha files first, then the EPIC/Story files, then the changed source and test files. Cross-reference against all review dimensions and produce your structured verdict.

RESPONSE-SIZE DISCIPLINE (ignoring it can abort your review and lose it): the model caps a SINGLE assistant response at 32000 output tokens, counting your extended thinking + prose + every tool-call input. You cannot see your own token count, so keep the verdict tight: never reproduce source code, full diffs, long logs, or an exhaustive per-AC table — state each finding as `<B/S> - action - name - one-line` with a `file:line` cite plus a compact coverage summary, and read only the line ranges you need.
```

**Clean up the reviewer draft.** The reviewer, like the engineers, leaves its draft temp behind for the orchestrator to remove. Delete it by its exact minted name — `rm -f '<REVIEWER_DRAFT>'` — so reviewer drafts do not accumulate under `.agent/tdd/` across review cycles.

**Parse the reviewer's verdict** into two lists by each finding's `action:` tag: `YES` = apply, `NO` = informational.

- **If any `action:YES` finding exists** → auto-route them through the TDD loop (single pass). Append **one** routing block to the discussion file — the lone post-seed write the orchestrator makes. Each `action:YES` becomes a `BLOCKER:` the test-engineer turns into a regression; each `action:NO` is recorded as `INFO:` so it survives to the human pause:

  ```bash
  cat >> '<discussion-file>' <<'WORK_EOF'
  AUTO_REVIEW: FAIL — routing <N> action:YES finding(s) to the TDD loop; <M> action:NO finding(s) recorded for the human.
  BLOCKER: <action:YES finding 1 — name + one-line description>
  INFO: <action:NO finding 1 — name + one-line description>
  WORK_EOF
  ```

  Then print the routed blockers, reset `turn_count` to 0, and **jump back to Step 5**. When the loop next reaches `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:`, the `AUTO_DONE` guard fires and the cycle proceeds to the human pause with only the `action:NO` findings.

- **If no `action:YES` finding exists** → print the reviewer's full verdict, present any `action:NO` findings, and proceed to Step 6c.

### 6c. Pause for human confirmation

The reviewer's verdict is the review. Stop the loop and present it to the human for confirmation. Do **not** close the lifecycle.

```
REVIEW COMPLETE — <EPIC_SLUG> [scope: <SCOPE>]

Any action:YES findings were auto-routed through the TDD loop and fixed; only the action:NO findings (above) were left unapplied. All in-scope Tasks are green and the in-scope verification gate passed.

Record your decision in the discussion file (append, do not edit) and re-run /work with the same flags:
  - To accept:    append `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS`
  - To send back: append `HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL` followed by one `BLOCKER: <issue>` line per finding to fix

Discussion file: <DISCUSSION_FILE>

Next (variant mode): once every dependent variant cycle reads PASS and is committed, run `/work <epic> --join --base <base-ref>` to merge and gate all variants together.
```

**Sketch mode (`SKETCH=true`)** — use the sketch pause message from `Not applicable — this project has no sketch phase; all work is test-gated and the --sketch flag must error (there is no Phase A and no artifact-only review)` instead (it points the human at the proof artifacts and the feedback dir). Jump to Step 8 with `reason=awaiting-human-review`.

### 6d. Review failure routing

When the human recorded `HUMAN_REVIEW: FAIL`:

1. Collect all `BLOCKER:` lines that follow the failing verdict.
2. Print them to the user.
3. Reset `turn_count` to 0.
4. Jump back to Step 5. The test engineer turns testable blockers into failing regression tests; the software engineer fixes them. When the TE signals `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` again, Step 6 re-runs.

Note: if the human fails review 3 times in one `/work` invocation, stop with `lifecycle=review-loop-limit` and let the human intervene directly.

## Step 7 — Close

Reached when Step 6a confirms `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS`. That line **is** the closing record — there is no frontmatter or status board to update.

- **Serial mode**: the EPIC is done. Report closed, continue to Step 8 with `lifecycle=closed`.
- **Variant mode**: only this *scope* is done — the EPIC is not closed until `--join` gates every variant. Report `<SCOPE> scope closed`, remind the human to commit the worktree branch so `--join` and the other variants' `--base` can see it, and continue to Step 8 with `lifecycle=closed` (for this scope).

## Join mode (`--join`)

Entered from Step 1 when `--join` is set. Join does not run a TDD loop — it integrates the finished variant branches and runs the EPIC's full Verification Gate on **every** target.

### J1. Pre-flight
- `REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.
- Every dependent variant branch exists: `work/<epic-slug>-<variant>` for each. If any is missing, abort naming it.
- Each variant's discussion file has a latest `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS`. If any has not passed, abort: `"join refused: <variant> has not passed human review"`.

### J2. Build the join worktree and merge
```bash
JOIN_BRANCH="work/<epic-slug>-join"
JOIN_PATH="$REPO_ROOT/../kanthord-worktrees/<epic-slug>-join"
git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree add -b "$JOIN_BRANCH" "$JOIN_PATH" "<base-ref>"
git -C "$JOIN_PATH" merge --no-ff <all variant branches>
```
If the merge reports conflicts → stop and hand to the human. Conflicts should be rare (variants edit disjoint dirs); a conflict in the shared layer means both variants diverged it and a human must reconcile.

### J3. Gate every target
Set `<root>` = `JOIN_PATH`. Run the env pre-flight (Step 4). Seed a join discussion file (`scope: join`, `opener: test-engineer`). Dispatch **one** test-engineer turn (the Step 5f prompt with scope `all`) plus:

> Do not write new tests. Run the EPIC's full `## Verification Gate` on EVERY target (`core` only (single variant) — run npm run typecheck then npm test; --join is effectively a no-op since there is nothing to merge). Append a turn reporting each target's exit code; if all are green append `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:`, otherwise name the failing target/test and end the turn.

### J4. Hand to human
- Both/all gates green → pause for human review like Step 6c (verdict in the join discussion file). On `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS` the EPIC is done — the human merges the join branch and removes the worktrees. `reason=join-ready`.
- A gate is red → report the failing target/test. The human routes the fix to the relevant `--variant` cycle (re-run it, re-PASS, re-join). Do not fix it in the join worktree. `reason=join-gate-failed`.

Then go to Step 8.

## Step 8 — Exit

When the run ends, print a one-line summary:
- `done · mode=<serial|variant:<V>|join> · turns=<N> · reason=<...> · human_review=<PASS|FAIL|pending> · lifecycle=<opened|closed> · root=<root>`

`lifecycle=opened` means the discussion file was seeded this run; `closed` means a `HUMAN_REVIEW: PASS` was confirmed. Then print a short bullet list of what happened this run.

**Worktree cleanup (variant/join modes).** Never auto-remove a worktree. When the human has merged a branch:

```bash
git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree remove ../kanthord-worktrees/<epic-slug>-<scope>
git -C "$REPO_ROOT" branch -d work/<epic-slug>-<scope>    # only after it is merged
```

## Notes for the orchestrator (you)

- Use `Bash` for `grep`/`sed`/`tail`/`awk`/path checks and the one-time seed. Use `Read` for the EPIC's `## Verification Gate`. Use `Agent` for subagent dispatch. The orchestrator touches the discussion file only via the Step 3 seed and the Step 6b auto-review block.
- Do not summarize, judge, or editorialize turns between dispatches. You dispatch; you do not participate.
- Test engineer always opens. The first dispatch is always `test-engineer` if the file is fresh (software-engineer in sketch mode).
- If the user interrupts, stop cleanly. Each subagent's append is atomic, and the orchestrator holds no other mutable state.
- **Parallel discipline (variant mode).** base variant first → commit → dependent variant cycles with `--base <base-ref>` in their own worktrees → `--join`. Each cycle is fully isolated. Never run two cycles of the *same* variant concurrently.
- **GREEN-only Task flow.** Some Tasks have no `Action — RED:` block. The cycle is compressed: TE writes a GREEN-ONLY pass-through → SE implements GREEN+REFACTOR → TE runs a build-only check (no test) and advances.
- **Sketch mode summary.** SE-only turns through the sketch stories (5d never alternates), SE is the discussion-file opener, env pre-flight may be skipped (see the env pre-flight rule), the lane check additionally allows the proof-artifact dir, and the exit is the same `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW:` marker → reviewer with Phase A scope → human visual review.
